### Requirements

Write a purpose statement for a mock web page you will be creating. e.g. "An ecommerce site for dolphin accessories" or "A gallery of my niece's horse shows."

Following your purpose statement, build a site that uses each of the following elements at least once. You may create any number of pages to do this.

*Do not use a stylesheet until the [CSS2: Basic Practice](/exercises/css/css-basic-practice) exercise.*

- doctype, html, head, body 
- title, meta
- div, span 
- p, a, h1-h6, img, em, strong, del, ins, br, hr 
- header, footer, section, article, aside, nav 
- address, blockquote, abbr, caption, cite, q, sup, time 
- ul, ol, li, dl, dt, dd, pre, code 
- table, thead, tbody, tfoot, th, tr, td, colgroup, col 
- form, input, label, fieldset, select, textarea, button 

Other tags you should be aware of:

- link, script
- video, iframe 

There are errors in HTML that the browser will automatically correct in many cases, but in other cases may lead to incorrect display to users or search engines. To avoid this, always validate your HMTL using [validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org). Make sure your HTML passes the validator before submitting your solution.
